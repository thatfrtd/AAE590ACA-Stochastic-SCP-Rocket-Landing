  Origin:
    The dataset originates from the stochastic susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model
    to simulate the spread of an infectuous desease.

Dataset description:
--------------------------
 
  The experimental design was generated by Latin hypercube sampling (LHS). The model responses were obtained
  by an in-house Matlab code based on the function "sirSimulate" in R of the package hetGP. 
  
  A validation set is generated using LHS and each point is replicated 10000 times to obtain a representation
  of the reference response PDF.

Description of inputs and outputs:
---------------------------
  SIR2d.mat:
  The orginal simulator with the input being two-dimensional (see [1]):
  Xtrain      : Experimental design of size N=500
  Ytrain      : Model responses at Xtrain without replication
  Xval        : Validation samples of size N=100 with 10000 replications
  Yval        : Model responses at Xval
